      <h1 style="color: black;" id="history"> OUR HISTORY</h1>
      The Story of the Speke Group dates back to the Legend of Captain John Hannington Speke from whom the Group <br>
      takes its name. The British Explorer, credited as the First European to discover Lake Victoria in East Africa
      which <br> he correctly identified as the Source of The Nile. <br>
      <br>
      It is this prestigious background that set the stage for the naming of Uganda’s only centurial hotel, Speke Hotel.
      <br>

      Speke Hotel was the first Hotel to be acquired as a member of the Ruparelia Group in 1996 by Dr. Sudhir Ruparelia.
      Its <br>unrivalled heritage has made Speke Hotel a key destination in the heart of Kampala draped with the
      colonial ambiance that <br> can be traced back to the 1920’s when the hotel was built and this same aura has been
      maintained and preserved over <br> the years.
      <br>
      The dedication and vision to continue creating luxurious and modern accommodation with a true sense of warm
      hospitality <br>
      grew gradually and the next stage in the Group’s expansion came ten years later in 2006, with the completion of
      Munyonyo <br> Commonwealth Resort in a record time of 11 months. Shortly after, Kabira Country Club was added to
      the Group hotels,<br> offering a world class abode for guests and travelers.
